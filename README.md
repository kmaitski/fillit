Filllit is project for 42 where the goal is to find the smallest grid possible to place multiple tetris pieces and to print the
grid with all of the pieces on the standard input.  Pieces must be placed in the order they are received.  The program will
display an error if the tetris pieces are formatted incorrectly.  The maximum amount of pieces is 26. This project utilizes
recursive backtracking to solve the problem.  Try it for yourself by ./fillit testfile.txt. You can also change the pieces by
editing the txt file.
